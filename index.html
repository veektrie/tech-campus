      This is a symbolic park named after the legend
      <a href="#">Chief Gani Fawehinmi</a>, A lawyer per excellence and an
      advocate for the common man. Fawehinmi, popularly called Gani, was born on
      22 April 1938, the son of Saheed and Munirat Fawehinmi of Ondo, in Ondo
      State. His father, Chief Saheed Tugbobo Fawehinmi, the Seriki Musulumi of
      Ondo, was a successful timber trader, philanthropist, civic activist and
      muslim chieftain of the Yoruba people. He was reported to be a follower of
      Ajao, who brought Islam to Ondo City, southwestern Nigeria. Chief Saheed
      Tugbobo Fawehinmi died on 5 February 1963 at the age of 89 years. Gani's
      grandfather was the late Chief Lisa Alujanu Fawehinmi of Ondo, who engaged
      in several successful battles for and on behalf of the Ondo people in the
      nineteenth century. Hence, the appellation the 'Alujanun', which means
      spirit. He died at the age of 92. Gani had his early education at
      Ansar-Ud-Deen Primary School, Iyemaja â€“ Ondo from 1947 to 1953 and his
      secondary school education at Victory College Ikare, a Christian School
      from 1954 to 1958, under the leadership of the Late Rev. Akinrele where he
      sat for and passed his West African School Certificate Examination in
      1958. While in college, he was popularly known as "Nation" because of his
      passionate interest in national, legal and political affairs. He was an
      avid reader of Daily Times and West African Pilot, the most popular
      newspapers in Nigeria at that time. He then worked briefly as a law clerk
      in the High Court of Lagos until 1961. Gani enrolled at the Holborn
      College of Law- University of London to read law in 1961.

      I went to the park to take pictures for my photography assignment. I'm
      really proud such size of attraction was dedicated to Gani Fawehinmi.
    </p>
    <p>He was a man of honour and justice</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The park had beautiful sceneries,though it needs more security,because of
      the Ojota opportunist. It requires maintenance too. But overall I loved it
